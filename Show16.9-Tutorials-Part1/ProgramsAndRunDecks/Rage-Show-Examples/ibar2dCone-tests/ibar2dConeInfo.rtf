\f1 ibar2dCone2.input
\f0  is a SAGE input file for an bar hitting a reflection of itself at a 45 degree angle. 
\f1 ibarPlane.input 
\f0 is a SAGE input file for an plane 2D bar hitting a rigid boundary. The examples are run by loading the 
\f1 ibarPlane.input dump files into a 
\f0 window named "s" and the 
\f1 ibar2dCone2.input dump files into a 
\f0 window named "d". The testing scripts are then run from an Expression Window using the "Evaluate" or "Export" option from the "Operations" menu.\
\
	
\f1 densityCompare.exp
\f0  is a Show expression script that plots the density from the  two calculations side by side and the percentage difference of the two calculations.\
\
	
\f1 sxyCompare.exp
\f0  is a Show expression script that plots the sxy stress from the  two calculations side by side and the percentage difference of the two calculations. The script includes the rotation of the 
\f1 ibar2dCone2.input stress to the unrotated system of ibarPlane.input.
